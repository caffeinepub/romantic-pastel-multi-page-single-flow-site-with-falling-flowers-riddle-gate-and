  "summary": "Most AI-generated image dependencies appear removed by replacing sprite-based petal rendering with canvas primitives and by removing fixed photos from Riddle and Intermediate pages. However, the diff does not show changes to LandingPage.tsx (and the updated file summary still describes a floral-textured title), so it’s not fully evidenced that the Landing page title no longer uses the generated floral texture image or that all remaining \"/assets/generated/\" references are eliminated.",

      "reason": "LandingPage.tsx is not shown as modified, and the provided frontend file summary still describes the Landing page title as \"floral-textured\", which suggests the generated texture reference may still be in use.",

      "reason": "The diff demonstrates removal of sprite usage in the effects components and removal of fixed photos on Riddle/Intermediate, but it does not include or show LandingPage.tsx or a repo-wide removal of \"/assets/generated/\" references, so this acceptance criterion is not fully evidenced as satisfied.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (truncated): LandingPage description still implies a floral texture asset may be used",
