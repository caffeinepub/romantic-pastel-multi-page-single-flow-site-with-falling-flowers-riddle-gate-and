  "summary": "REQ-22 appears implemented: FinalPage no longer renders any “This is you” heading, while keeping “this is for you” immediately above the photo upload component. REQ-23 appears implemented: the centralized strings file no longer contains the user-facing value “This is you 🌷”. However, the diff also changes Final page note copy in strings.ts, which was not requested and may violate the constraint to avoid changing other copy beyond removing the heading text.",
